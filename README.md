# UN POP - Helpline Assessment

This GitHub repository contains a Streamlit application designed to evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and accessibility of digital channels and helpline services in ensuring the safety of children in various countries. The application consists of three main parts:

1. **Form**: Users are presented with a set of 10 questions that cover different areas of helpline evaluation. These questions help assess the performance of helplines based on user inputs.
2. **AHP Model**: The user's responses from the form are scored against an ideal score using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model, which incorporates expert insights. This scoring mechanism provides an evaluation of the helpline's performance.
3. **Recommendations**: The application identifies the top three areas in which the helpline has room for improvement. It provides extensive recommendations to enhance the helpline's performance in those areas. Additionally, users have the option to gather custom recommendations specific to their country.

To learn more about the UN POP (Protection Through Online Participation) project, which focuses on understanding how children and youth use digital platforms for safety, please refer to the [UN POP website](https://violenceagainstchildren.un.org/content/pop). The project aims to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the functioning of online protection systems and share recommendations for implementing and improving these services. With the involvement of United Nations Agencies, over 30 global partners, including private sector companies, academia, civil society organizations, and children and young people themselves, the project strives to ensure that every child who has access to the Internet can also access online protection systems.
