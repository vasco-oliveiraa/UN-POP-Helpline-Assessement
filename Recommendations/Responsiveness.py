    st.markdown("Based on successful experiences in providing support for children in situations of danger through online channels and helplines, here are some recommendations:")

    # Recommendation 1: Staff Adequately and Train Them
    with st.expander("1. Staff Adequately and Train Them"):
        st.write("Ensure that digital channels and helplines are adequately staffed by trained professionals who are equipped to handle various situations. Provide comprehensive training to staff members on active listening, empathetic communication, and effective problem-solving. Continuously invest in their professional development to enhance their skills and knowledge.")

    # Recommendation 2: Establish Response Time Standards
    with st.expander("2. Establish Response Time Standards"):
        st.write("Define response time standards for different types of inquiries or situations. Establish benchmarks for acknowledging messages or calls and set goals for providing initial responses and resolving issues. Strive to respond to urgent cases promptly, ideally within minutes, and aim to address non-urgent inquiries within a reasonable timeframe, such as 24 to 48 hours.")

    # Recommendation 3: Utilize Automation and AI Technologies
    with st.expander("3. Utilize Automation and AI Technologies"):
        st.write("Leverage automation and AI technologies to enhance responsiveness. Implement chatbots or automated response systems to acknowledge and provide immediate support for common inquiries or FAQs. Utilize AI algorithms to prioritize urgent messages or identify potential high-risk situations, enabling faster response times for critical cases.")

    # Recommendation 4: Continuously Monitor and Improve Service Quality
    with st.expander("4. Continuously Monitor and Improve Service Quality"):
        st.write("Regularly monitor and evaluate the service quality of digital channels and helplines. Implement feedback mechanisms, such as surveys or user feedback forms, to gather insights from children and other users. Use this feedback to identify areas for improvement, address bottlenecks, and enhance the overall responsiveness and effectiveness of the services.")
