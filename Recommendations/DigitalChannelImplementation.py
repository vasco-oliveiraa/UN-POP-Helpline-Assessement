    st.markdown("Based on successful experiences in providing support for children in situations of danger through online channels and helplines, here are some recommendations:")

    # Recommendation 1: Streamline Launch Process
    with st.expander("1. Streamline Launch Process"):
        st.write("Establish a clear and streamlined launch process for digital channels and helplines. Create a project plan that outlines the necessary steps, timelines, and responsibilities for implementation. This plan should include activities such as infrastructure setup, software development, staff training, and testing procedures.")

    # Recommendation 2: Conduct Infrastructure Assessment
    with st.expander("2. Conduct Infrastructure Assessment"):
        st.write("Conduct a thorough assessment of the IT infrastructure requirements for launching digital channels and helplines. Evaluate the existing infrastructure's capacity to handle increased traffic and ensure its compatibility with the chosen communication platforms. Identify any gaps or limitations and develop a plan to address them.")

    # Recommendation 3: Collaborate with IT Experts
    with st.expander("3. Collaborate with IT Experts"):
        st.write("Engage with IT experts and technology partners who specialize in developing and implementing digital solutions. Seek their guidance and expertise in selecting appropriate platforms, optimizing infrastructure, and ensuring data security and privacy. Collaborative partnerships can greatly enhance the launch and implementation process.")

    # Recommendation 4: Test and Monitor System Performance
    with st.expander("4. Test and Monitor System Performance"):
        st.write("Conduct extensive testing of the digital channels and helpline systems before the official launch. Test for usability, functionality, and reliability to identify any potential issues or vulnerabilities. Establish monitoring mechanisms to track system performance and address any technical glitches or user experience challenges promptly.")
